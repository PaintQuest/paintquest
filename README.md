# PaintQuest

The idea of PaintQuest (which by the way is just a workname and may be changed) is a browserbased shared canvas which can grow and be infinitely large. This means that all users connected will work on the same canvas in realtime. Think of it like a paint equivalent to Minecraft. Another similar application (but for text) is "Your world of text" which can be found here: https://www.yourworldoftext.com/.
